We will have “bricks”, “ball” and “stand” and they will have a lot in common.
They will move around the field and render.
So they all will have coordinates and size.
And also the move () methods for moving and draw () for rendering.
There is an interesting suggestion: let's introduce one base class for all objects.
Let it be the BaseObject class.
And Ball, Stand, Brick classes are inherited from it.
Create a BaseObject class and add it as a parent to the Ball, Stand, Brick classes
We also need the Canvas class.
He will be responsible for the "rendering" of objects.
With it, they will draw themselves.
Rather, even on it, but I will inform you of the details later.
Create this class too.

Requirements:
1. The BaseObject class must be created in a separate file.
2. The Canvas class must be created in a separate file.
3. The Ball class must be a descendant of the BaseObject class.
4. The Brick class must be a descendant of the BaseObject class.
5. The Stand class must be a descendant of the BaseObject class.
